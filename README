This is an incomplete implementation of a web framework for Scheme48.
It runs from a standalone HTTP server (included), and features a
persistent memory structure and cursor gadget designed to support
functional updates over a native tree structure as the primary mode of
operation. The "memory" framework is organized in anticipation of
merging the memory heap between several identical servers.

It contains bits of interesting code. This code is under the BSD
license, see the file LICENSE in this repository.
