;;;; Scanned Graph
;;;;
;;;; A scanned graph is a "shadow" over the persisted graph.  It scans
;;;; the source code, sets up interfaces and structures, and can be
;;;; used to enforce access control.  This graph format is useful for
;;;; a system-level "plist-style" editor.
;;;;
;;;; It is called "scanned" because the code in each node is not
;;;; evaluated, so this tree format is still in a partially passive
;;;; state.  See persisted-graph.

;;;; Node

;;; A source node is scanned in this way:
;;;   * A shallow scan is passed over its code to return a
;;;     "plist-style" mapping of top-level definitions to their forms.
;;;   * The code is evaluated into a package and structures are
;;;     produced corresponding to the interfaces implemented by the
;;;     node.
